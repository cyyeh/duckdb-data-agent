## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

since now if not using non-anthropic model, we could only use model from orchestrator model, I propose a method to allow each subagent using its own model

in env vars, I could add "@haiku", "@opus", "@sonnet" as the end of model name, so under the hood, you could send "haiku/opus/sonnet" depending on the suffix, but remember to send real model name(removing "@haiku/@opus/@sonnet" before sending to bifrost), what do you think?

# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration
